abbreviation	detailed_explanations
CHROM	chromosome 
POS	The reference position, with the 1st base having position 1
REF	reference base(s)
ALT	alternate base(s)
DP	Total read depth at the locus
RO	Reference allele observation count, with partial observations recorded fractionally
AO	Alternate allele observations, with partial observations recorded fractionally
ALLELE	Allele (or ALT): In case of multiple ALT fields, this helps to identify which ALT we are referring to
EFFECT	Annotation (a.k.a. effect): Annotated using Sequence Ontology terms. Multiple effects can be concatenated using '&'
IMPACT	Putative_impact: A simple estimation of putative impact / deleteriousness : {HIGH, MODERATE, LOW, MODIFIER}
FEATURE	Which type of feature is in the next field (e.g. transcript, motif, miRNA, etc.).
FEATUREID	Depending on the annotation, this may be: Transcript ID (preferably using version number), Motif ID, miRNA, ChipSeq peak, Histone mark, etc.
GENE	Gene NameCommon gene name (HGNC). Optional: use closest gene when the variant is "intergenic".
GENEID	Gene ID: Gene ID
BIOTYPE	Transcript biotype:The bare minimum is at least a description on whether the transcript is {Coding, Noncoding}. Whenever possible, use ENSEMBL biotypes.
HGVS_C	HGVS.c:Variant using HGVS notation (DNA level)
HGVS_P	HGVS.p:If variant is coding, this field describes the variant using HGVS notation (Protein level). Since transcript ID is already mentioned in feature ID, it may be omitted here.
